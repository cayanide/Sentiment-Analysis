I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you‚Äôd expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it‚Äôs almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, ‚ÄúWelcome to the 21st century!‚ÄùThe display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It‚Äôs crazy how much has changed‚Äîface ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you‚Äôre thinking about upgrading, especially if you‚Äôre coming from a much older model like I was, don‚Äôt hesitate.
